					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned 10 things exactly! Bait and Swtich, disguested ads ... Those concepts are foreign to me. Honestly, most of the time I am browseing the web without thinking about the designs behind it and just go ahead and use it. Now I have been introudced to those dard design patterns, I can be better at recongizing what is a bad intention therefore to avoid being tripped </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I loved how the article goes over and breaks down the differnet types of dard design patterns so I can be aware of it. Most of the time, I am being baited becuase I am simply unaware of what is a trap. Understanding what a trip looks like in the underlying format makes recongizing it easier! </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> Dark Patterns are deceptive UX/UI interactions, designed to mislead or trick users to make them do something they donâ€™t want to do. </p>
