      <p>Article responces:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>This article has opened my eye to pay attention to the design of an app, rather than just using it. I've also learned on a high level that to develop a "better" sense of design, you need to look at how other app(s) are designed to seek for inspirations </li>
        <li>I loved the animation of the article; it is very visual. As each design component appears one by one, my eye is able to focus on that region which simulates me to think about oh, that exists for reasons x, y, z </li>
        <li><em>"Donâ€™t just use apps, study them"</em></li>
        <li>I score a 8 to this article</li>
