					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I like the strategy that all paddings are a multiple of 8 which creates consistency on the webpage. I also like how they emphasis on the idea that white space provides greater focus on the element you are trying to show. I also liked the visual images this article provides (one with little spacing one with more spacing) to allow the user see this visual organization happening. I also liked the fact they showed large areas of white space do not need to be filled with content </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I am a visual learner so wherever I see images to illustrate the point of the article it catches my eye. I liked pictures are used in this article to make the concept eaiser to understand. I also enjoyed learning the trick of multiples of 8 pixes in a webpage to create visual consistency </p>
