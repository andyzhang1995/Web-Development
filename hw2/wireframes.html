					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!)</p>
							<p> [INSERT YOUR WIREFRAMES HERE] </p>
							<img src="assets/imgs/before.jpg"/>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>
							<p> [INSERT YOUR WIREFRAMES HERE] </p>
							<img src = "assets/imgs/after.jpg"/>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p> The website I chose is YouTube. Its goal is to show video content. The video I chose was dance related so it's intended for other user who are interested in dancing to view. The design accomplishes this by placing the video at the center where users can see directly </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p> The website I chose is well established so I really don't think adding more spacing or deleting more spacing would help since we are talking about YouTube.. </p>
						</li>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just put it in your assets folder!</p></li>
						<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
						<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe.png"/>
